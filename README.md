# Jets Application
This program keeps a virtual record of a fleet of Jets, which the user can examine
and alter.

### Description
To run the program, the user is shown a menu through which they can see the details
of the fleet as well as either adding or removing jets from the fleet. Certain types of 
jets are showcased through interfaces.

uml diagrams on paper.
